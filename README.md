To run this code you need to run main.py, but before running it, you need to config your .env file with the following variables.

```txt
SENDER = 'example@example.com'
RECEIVER = 'example@example.com'
USER = 'example@example.com'
PASS = 'password'

```
 SENDER and RECEIVER are variables that correspond to the email config.

 USER and PASS are the credentials to enter your email.
